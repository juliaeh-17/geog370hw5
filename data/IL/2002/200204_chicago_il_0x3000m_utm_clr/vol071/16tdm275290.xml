<abstract>"An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y). Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500- by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage."</abstract>
<purpose>"These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as plan for homeland security efforts."</purpose>
<supplinf>The data obtained through The Seamless Server is considered to be the "best available" data from USGS.  Historical data and other data may be obtained by contacting Customer Services, Center for Earth Resources Observation &amp; Science, at 1-800-252-4547. Information in quotation marks, initial processing steps, accuracy reports, and source information is taken directly from the original metadata.</supplinf>

<attraccr>"During photographic reproduction of the source photographs, limited analog dodging (radiometric editing) is performed to improve image quality. Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to ensure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from the brightness values of the original images because of image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto with the original unrectified image to determine if the digital orthophoto has the same or better image quality as the original unrectified input image. Slight systematic radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source photograph capture dates and sun angles along flight lines when the aerial photographs were taken. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching."</attraccr>

<srccontr>Project Control was used to provide ground truth information to the aero triangulation process.  It was provided in two ways: (1) 21 photo identifiable ground control points were established and (2) five (5) Airborne GPS Base-Stations. The Airborne GPS Base-Stations were used to provide differential airborne GPS coordinates of each exposure station.  The 21 ground control points, in conjunction with the airborne GPS exposure station coordinates, were used as control in the aero triangulation process.  This data ensures that the triangulation camera positions and orientations are tied to an accurate ground coordinate system.</srccontr>
</srcinfo>
<procstep>
<procdesc>Ground control points were collected to use as photo identifiable control in the aero triangulation process and as airborne GPS base stations.  Source imagery was collected using three Wild cameras (a 6" RC30, a 6" RC20 and a 12" RC30), all calibrated by USGS.  The imagery was processed by HAS Images Inc.  Ground control and airborne GPS data was processed by Woolpert LLP. Image negatives were scanned at 12-micrometer resolution by SAIC and Woolpert.  The scanned images were then used as input, along with ground control, airborne GPS data and camera calibration data into a LH Systems Socet Set for point mensuration.  The data was then processed through [j][f][k] Rabat's software. The aero triangulation parameter data (which includes adjusted position and orientation of the camera at time of exposure, along with the adjusted ground coordinates of all control, pass points and tie points) were orthorectified using the relevant USGS Digital Elevation Models.  These were processed using SAIC's GIS-MAGIC software or Z/I's OrthoPro package. The orthorectified images were then mosaicked (if necessary, to reduce the effects of micro-relief on the final product). Product tiles were then extracted from the orthorectified images or mosaic and converted to GeoTIFF format.  Product RMS accuracy was determined by either (1) evaluating the geographic location accuracy of aero triangulation points or (2) measuring the metric displacement of common features in adjacent tiles.  Metadata files were then created and populated to reflect the relevant tile and project data.  Product tiles and metadata were then written to DLT for delivery to USGS.</procdesc>
